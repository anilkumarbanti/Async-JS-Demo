# JavaScript Async Examples

This repository contains examples and explanations of various asynchronous programming concepts in JavaScript. It includes:

1. **Synchronous JavaScript**: Examples of synchronous code execution.
2. **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Examples of asynchronous code execution using `setTimeout`.
3. **Callbacks**: Demonstrates how to use callbacks to handle asynchronous operations.
4. **Callback Hell and Promises**: Explains the problem of callback hell and how promises can solve it.
5. **Promises**: Shows how to create and use promises.
6. **Async/Await**: Provides examples of using `async` and `await` for cleaner asynchronous code.
7. **Real-time Project Example**: Fetching and displaying user data from an API using `fetch` and `async/await`.
